## Hi there, I'm Jose! (◕ヮ◕)ﾉ
I am an autodidact. Though I've had plenty, I have a dim view of formal education. The kind that's confined by a curriculum, a path fenced-in. I like to set my own goals now. I learn by doing, setting on roads to natural discovery. Learning is *personal*, and I am using GitHub to show just some of the things I've learned.
